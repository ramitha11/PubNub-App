To run "Reserve", please follow the instructions as below

Step 1: Launch the user.html file on a browser which takes you to the web page.
Step 2: Enter the choice of restaurant in the text box.
		The 3 choices I have considered for simplicity are
			Nobu
			Anjappar
			Nando
		Please enter one of these choices and click on Submit.
Step 3: This redirects you to the restaurant web page.
Step 4: The number of vacant tables are displayed.
Step 5: The user is also given the option to make another selection by clicking on the Search Again button.

Idea behind the application

I have chosen two channels for data streaming.
Channel "a" is used by the user to publish his choice and all the three restaurants subscribe to know the user's choice.
Channel "b" is used by the restaurants to publish the number of vacant tables and the user subscribes to this to obtain the count.
